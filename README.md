# Stimulus Controllers

This project is comprised of 2 primary directories.

1. `packages` - the controller library

    Each subdirectory defines a controller

2. `playground` - a place to test the controller library

    Test pages are created at `src/html/COMPONENT_NAME.html`

## Quick Start

```sh
cd playground && yarn run webpack-dev-server
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/html/ in a browser.
